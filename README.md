# Traffic_violation_detection  

## Main problems
- Driver forgets a traffic code (for example: do not follow the red light). 
- Driving on some national network roads which haven’t any road signs. 
- Driver distraction ​to take the proper distance between vehicles. 
- Drivers' lack of respect for traffic regulations.
- Dangerous maneuvers. 
- Speeding.

## Why this project?  
Using this solution, we could help : 
- Saving drivers from paying fines 
- Improving road safety 
- Promote responsible driving that respects the highway code

## Project use case  
- Meeting road safety standards and reducing accident mortality by detecting and alerting the driver in real time about traffic violations. 

## Technical specification  
* Develop a system to detect objects on the road (road signs, traffic lights, etc.).  
* Develop a system capable of recognizing common violations such as speeding, disobeying traffic lights, etc.
* Design a model to estimate the braking distance between two vehicles.
* Integrate violation detection and braking distance prediction functionalities into a user-friendly interface.

## Steps to follow to develop the solution
1. Creation of a model for object detection (traffic signs, traffic lights)
2. Braking distance prediction
3. Development of a user interface for alerts: **Mobile application**
